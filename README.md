# MILINT AI Agent – Military Intelligence Document Analyzer

## Overview

The **MILINT AI Agent** is designed to analyze military intelligence documents and provide insights through threat assessments and summaries. This tool processes and interprets military reports, intercepted documents, and confidential files to aid military personnel, analysts, and decision-makers.

## Key Features

* **Threat Assessment**: Analyzes military reports for potential threats, vulnerabilities, and intelligence gaps.
* **Document Summarization**: Condenses lengthy military reports into clear and concise summaries, focusing on key events and insights.
* **AI-Driven Analysis**: Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze large volumes of text and extract actionable intelligence.
* **File Support**: Supports PDF file formats for seamless document upload and analysis.

## How to Use

1. **Upload a Military Report**: Drag and drop your military report (PDF) into the upload section.
2. **Start Analysis**: The system will analyze the document and process it to generate a threat assessment and summary.
3. **View Results**: After the analysis is complete, you’ll receive a summary of key insights, including identified threats and relevant intelligence.

## Example Workflow

1. **Upload PDF**: Upload a military report, such as the "1906 Military Report on Dir, Swat, and Bajaur."
2. **Analyze**: The system automatically processes the report to identify threats, key military activities, and strategic information.
3. **Review Summary**: Review the AI-generated summary and threat analysis to make informed decisions.

## Technologies Used

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For document parsing and summarization.
* **Machine Learning (ML)**: For threat detection and intelligence extraction.
* **Python & Libraries**: Includes `PyPDF2`, `spaCy`, and custom ML models for document analysis.
